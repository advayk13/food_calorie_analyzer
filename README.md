# 🍽️ Food Calorie & Macronutrient Predictor (Open Source)

This open-source project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the **calories and macronutrient content** of food from an image.  
It also provides nutritional suggestions through a Flask-based web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
- CNN model trained on a balanced food image dataset
- Estimates calories, protein, carbs, and fat
- Flask web app for easy user interaction
- Nutrition data stored in JSON format
- Built using open-source libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, etc.)
